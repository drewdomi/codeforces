# Codefoces problems by drewdomi

This repository contains my solutions for coding problems from platforms like **Codeforces**, written in **Go (Golang)**.

## 🚀 About
I'm practicing algorithms and data structures to improve my problem-solving skills.
All solutions are implemented in Go, focusing on clean, efficient and easy-to-understand code.

## 📂 Structure
Each folder contains:
- The problem ID
- A `id.go` file with the solution
- Optional notes or comments for learning purposes

## 🧠 Goals
- Strengthen logic and algorithmic thinking
- Practice competitive programming
- Build a clean archive of solved problems in Go

## 🛠 Tech
- **Language:** Go (Golang)
- **Focus:** Algorithms, Data Structures, Codeforces problem solving
